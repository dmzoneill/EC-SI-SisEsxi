VMware(r) End User License Agreement

VMware, Inc. ("VMware") provides the vSphere Command-Line Interface (vSphere CLI) 
and/or vSphere Software Development Kit for Perl (vSphere SDK for Perl) (collectively the 
"Software") to you subject to the following terms and conditions.  If you disagree with any of 
the following terms, then do not use the Software.

1.  The Software contains a variety of materials, interface definitions, documentation, sample utility 
applications and sample code regarding programming interfaces to one or more VMware products 
as referenced in such materials ("VMware Products").  This Software is intended to be used to 
execute supplied commands and utility applications and to create scripts that interact with the 
VMware Products. 

2.  Use Rights:  Subject to the restrictions below, you may download and make a reasonable 
number of copies of the Software contents for your use solely for the purpose of creating software 
that communicates with VMware Products ("Developer Software").  For vSphere SDK for Perl, 
some code may be designated as "distributable code" and/or "modifiable code" at 
http://www.vmware.com/go/vsdkperl-redistribution-info.  For vSphere CLI, some code may be 
designated as "distributable code" and/ or "modifiable code" at http://www.vmware.com/go/vcli-
redistribution-info.  You may use and merge all or portions of the "distributable code" with your 
Developer Software.  Any merged portion of any "distributable code" is subject to this Agreement.  
Additionally, you may modify or create derivative works of all or portions of the "modifiable 
code."  You are permitted to re-distribute the "distributable code" and the modified or derivative 
works of the "modifiable code" only as part of your Developer Software for non-commercial or 
commercial use.  Open source software components provided with the Software are licensed to you 
under the terms of the applicable license agreements included with such open source software 
components.  The open source software licenses can be found in the open_source_licenses.txt file, 
other materials accompanying the Software, the documentation or corresponding source files 
available at http://www.vmware.com/download/vi/open_source.html.

3.  Restrictions:  You agree that you will not (1) use the Software to create, design or develop 
anything other than Developer Software; (2) make any more copies of the Software than are 
reasonably necessary for the authorized use and backup and archival purposes; (3) modify, create 
derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Software, except as 
expressly permitted in Section 2; (4) distribute, sell, lease, rent, lend, or sublicense any part of the 
Software to any third party except as expressly permitted in Section 2 or; (5) use the Software to (a) 
create, design or develop software or service to circumvent, enable, modify or provide access, 
permissions or rights which would violate the technical restrictions of VMware Products, any 
additional licensing terms provided by VMware via product documentation, email notification 
and/or policy change on VMware website, and/or the terms of the End User License Agreements of 
VMware products; (b) disable, remove, over-ride or modify the display of any VMware product 
End User License Agreements to the end customers; and (c) upload or otherwise transmit any 
material containing software viruses or other computer code, files or programs designed to 
interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any software or hardware.  

The restrictions in this Section 3 shall not apply if and to the extent they contradict mandatory local 
law (including, but not limited to, law implementing the EC Software Directive) provided that, 
before you exercise any rights that you believe to be entitled to based on mandatory law, you 
provide VMware with 30 days prior written notice at SDK_Legal@vmware.com and provide all 
reasonably requested information to allow VMware to assess your claim and, at VMware's sole 
discretion, to provide alternatives that reduce any adverse impact on VMware's intellectual property 
or other rights.  

4.   VMware retains ownership of the Software, including without limitation all copyrights and other 
intellectual property rights therein. You may not remove, delete or modify any of VMware 
copyright statements in the Software.

5.  You may not use VMware's name, trademarks or service marks in your Developer Software's 
names or in a way that suggests your Developer Software is certified or endorsed by VMware. Your 
use of VMware product names and trademarks shall comply with the Branding Guidelines posted at 
www.vmware.com. 

6.  If you are currently entitled to support from VMware, you may submit a support request for 
installation assistance of this Software and assistance in executing unmodified utility applications or 
vSphere CLI commands provided with this Software.  Except as provided herein, you are not 
entitled to any VMware support for this Software or any other services from VMware in connection 
with this Software or your Developer Software.  

7.  Term, Termination and Changes: This Agreement shall continue as long as you are in 
compliance with the terms specified herein or until otherwise terminated.  You and or VMware 
each may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time.  You agree, upon termination, to 
destroy all copies of the Software within your possession or control. The Confidential Information, 
Limitations of Warranties, Liability and Indemnification sections set out in this Agreement shall 
survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 

8.  Limitations of Warranties and Liability:  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" 
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, VMWARE DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
RIGHTS.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL 
VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF 
USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE OR 
YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED 
IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.  BECAUSE 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

VMWARE'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL 
NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US$5.00.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY 
FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

9.  Indemnification: You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VMware, and any of its 
directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents, from and against any and all claims, losses, 
damages, liabilities and other expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), arising from your 
modification or derivative works of the "modifiable code", distribution or use of your Developer 
Software or breach of this Agreement.

10.  These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of 
America without regard to conflict of laws principles.  You may not assign any part of this 
Agreement without the prior written consent of VMware.  Any attempted assignment without 
consent shall be void. These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and VMware with 
respect to the Software, and supersede all prior written or oral communications, understandings and 
agreements. Any waiver of these terms must be in writing to be effective. If any provision of these 
terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and 
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
